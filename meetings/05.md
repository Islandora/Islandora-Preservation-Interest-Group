  * Decision: Any Islandora (F3) modules that need to write to the Audit Log should take their event type terms from the [auditTrail mapping vocabulary](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/FF/Audit+Service+Repository+Events+and+Agents). If the Islandora community needs to extend this list, they should do so in collaboration with the larger Fedora community.
